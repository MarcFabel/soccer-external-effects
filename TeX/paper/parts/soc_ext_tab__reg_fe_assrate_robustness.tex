			\item \scriptsize \emph{Notes:} The specifications use daily data (excluding June) spanning the time window 2011-2015 for regions that host games of a soccer team from the first two leagues of the German football league system. The outcome variable is defined as the number of assaults per million population. Except where otherwise noted, the specifications use population-weights. Days are defined to run from 6:00 AM until 5:59 AM the following day to accommodate the fact that offenses committed in the early hours have their origin in the preceding day. The effect size corresponds to the percent change of the assault rate due to a soccer game in relation to the mean when no game takes place. All specifications use region and date fe, their interactions, weather controls, and holiday FE. Two-way clustered standard errors at region-year and year-month level are reported in parentheses. \newline Significance levels: * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.\newline \hspace*{15pt} $^1$: number of assaults is dependent variable.
