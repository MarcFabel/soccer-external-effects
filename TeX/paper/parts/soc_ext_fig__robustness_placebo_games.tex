		\scriptsize{\emph{Notes:} The figure shows the effect of placebo games. Panel A presents the distribution of the coefficients (along with a normal density) after 10,000 iterations. Panel B shows the distribution of the t-statistics and the resulting ranges of significant coefficients, with a level of significance $\alpha=0.05$. Panel C shows the fraction of significant estimates across the number of iterations.}
